# CS1410
All assignments from CS2. Throwback!

## Disclaimer:
Some of this code is not my own and is the work of Dr. Sundberg.
This is especially true of the tic-tac-toe project, and probably others.
Any work of Dr. Sundberg's in this repository was provided as starter code for an assignment.
This was an introductory computer science course, and therefore it should be easy to tell what I wrote and what Dr. Sundberg wrote.

Handy guide: The parts of the code that are good are probably the parts that Dr. Sundberg wrote.
